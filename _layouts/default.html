      <p><strong>What should I wear?</strong></p>
      <p>Our theme is old cinema and dressing in theme is gleefully encouraged, though not required. Jodi is always cold in movie theatres, so she suggests bringing a sweater.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Are kids welcome?</strong></p>
      <p>This wedding is adults-only.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Can I bring a date?</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Will food be served?</strong></p>
      <p>There will be theater concessions as well as cake and other sweets. If you would like to contribute to the dessert potluck, please contact Jodi.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Do we have to pay for drinks?</strong></p>
      <p>Guests will receive two tickets which may be redeemed for drinks. If you would like more than two you must pay.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Will there be dancing/bouquet-garter toss/dollar dance/first dance?</strong></p>
      <p>Not at the cinema, but please join us for our after-party/reception at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=woodlands+tavern&hl=en&ll=39.986459,-83.037608&spn=0.009897,0.020835&fb=1&gl=us&hq=woodlands+tavern&hnear=0x883888411d20f7b9:0x4a4da225635b628c,Bexley,+OH&cid=0,0,10985986198101086030&t=h&z=16&iwloc=A">Woodland's Tavern</a> with live music by Change It Up Charlie, dancing, merriment and all the fun/tacky/sometimes awful trappings of a wedding reception. There is no cover charge at the bar and it is open to the public. It is a cash bar.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What time will the reception end?</strong></p>
      <p>The reception at the cinema ends at 5 pm. The reception/after-party at Woodlandâ€™s Tavern begins at 9 pm, though you may go immediately after the cinema reception concludes if you like.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Can I take pictures?</strong></p>
      <p>We kindly ask that you refrain from taking photographs during the ceremony. The couple has hired a team of photographers from <a href="http://www.jrdphotography.com/">JRD Photography</a> and will happily share all photographs with all of you. However, photos and video are encouraged at the reception and after-party. We only request copies for ourselves as well.</p>
